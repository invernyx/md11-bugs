## Reporting Bugs
Before submitting an issue, you should verify that your issue [has not already been reported](https://github.com/invernyx/md11-bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug%2C%22verification+required%22). If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one with any further information you may be able to present.

To report a bug, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/invernyx/md11-bugs/issues/new/choose) using the respective bug report template. Using the incorrect template will mean that we don't have the information we require, so we may close the issue and ask you to refile it under the correct template.

## Stale issues
Issues will go stale if we have not received the information we required after 12 days. We will then bump you on the issue, letting you know the issue is stale. If we do not receive a response within 48 hours, we will close the issue and you will be required to resubmit.

# What to Expect with The Current Version
The aircraft stability and feature level is at an early-access level. This means **there will be noticeable bugs** and **some minor systems are missing**.

If you are expecting a polished, smooth experience on every flight, do not fly the aircraft yet. If you are looking forward to helping us refine and finish what is on its way to becoming one of the most complex aircraft on the market, we encourage you to join us in the skies.
