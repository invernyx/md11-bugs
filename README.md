# TFDi Design MD-11 Issue Tracking
This is the official bug report repository for the TFDi Design MD-11. Here you will find known issues, existing reports, and to-do items for the project.

## Why are there so many issues on a released product?
No product is ever perfect and many have lists just like this. We are choosing to leave our bugs repository public and open so we can continue to interface with our customers and improve the product.

## Who submits bugs to this?
We work with the internal quality assurance (QA) team and the Collector's Edition owners to collect feedback and suggestions. If you ended up here as a presale or retail customer, please go through the helpdesk or Discord to report issues or make suggestions.

## Reporting Bugs
Before submitting an issue, you should verify that your issue [has not already been reported](https://github.com/invernyx/md11-bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug%2C%22verification+required%22). If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one with any further information you may be able to present.

To report a bug, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/invernyx/md11-bugs/issues/new/choose) using the respective bug report template. Using the incorrect template will mean that we don't have the information we require, so we may close the issue and ask you to refile it under the correct template.
